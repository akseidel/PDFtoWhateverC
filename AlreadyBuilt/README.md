# AlreadyBuilt   

File                      | Description
--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PDFtoWhateverC.exe        | The already built program.
Magick.NET-Q16-AnyCPU.dll | The .NET ImageMagick resource that is required to be in the folder with PDFtoWhateverC.exe.

##### Note:

Even though a .NET version of ImageMagick is included here, which means you do not have to have ImageMagick loaded on your computer, you still have to have GhostScript loaded on your computer because ImageMagick relies on GhostScript for its PDF operations. This program really should have been made without using Magick.NET and just relied on both ImageMagick and GhostScript loaded on your computer.
